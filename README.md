This is machine learning project.This project is made using Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Keras libraries.<br>
This project is made in Du Hacks 3.0 hackathon.

We have built a stock prediction graph from the data based on previous years. We used public api to fetch the data and tried to predict the stock behaviour using statistical methods.

We have used pandas, numpy and keras libraries available in python for the functionalities.
